# Scratch-text_base


This programimg language is VPL(NonVusualProgrammingLanguage).ã€€And CUI application execution environment.  

Always, Scratch is developed in [https://scratch.mit.edu/](https://scratch.mit.edu/).  
Howwver , this is GUI only. I looked for CUI but I couldn't fibnd it.
So, I make new language which Scratch text based.  

Syntax is referred by offcial Scratch v3.

# Non VPL

It means you can write code on elese of Scratch offcial page and can develop on text editors(such as [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) ,Vim(https://www.vim.org/), atom(https://atom.io/), emacs(https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/)) in the future.

# CUI
 
You can rub scratch at terminal in the future. 

sorry, I don't finished to write this.
