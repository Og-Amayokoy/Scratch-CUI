# Scratch-text_base


This programimg language is VPL(NonVusualProgrammingLanguage).ã€€And CUI application execution environment.  

Always, Scratch is developed in [https://scratch.mit.edu/](https://scratch.mit.edu/).  
Howwver , this is GUI only. I looked for CUI but I couldn't fibnd it.
So, I make new language which Scratch text based.  

Syntax is referred by offcial Scratch v3.

# Non VPL

# CUI
