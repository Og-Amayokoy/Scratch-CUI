# Scratch-text_base

**Hey,Yo. Can you help me up?**    

**Pull request? AwsomeðŸ˜€!**    

**Report Issue? Thank youðŸ˜Š!**  



This programimg language is VPL(NonVusualProgrammingLanguage).ã€€And CUI application execution environment.  

Scratch is developed at [https://scratch.mit.edu/](https://scratch.mit.edu/).  
However , this is GUI only. I looked for CUI but I couldn't fibnd it.
So, I make new language which Scratch text based.  

Syntax is referred by offcial Scratch v3.

# Non GUI

It means you can write code on elese of Scratch offcial page and can develop on text editors(such as [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) ,[Vim](https://www.vim.org/), [atom](https://atom.io/), [emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/)) in the future.

# CUI
 
You can run scratch at terminal in the future such as node.jp,python,ruby. 



sorry, I don't finished to write this.
